                <h1>She Fell In Love With Someone Else</h1>
                <p>Nothing had ever made me so happy. I remember thinking of her every night,
                    our future, our present, and how to make us grow. I remember creating plans 
                    in my head of all the places we were going to go together, the many countries we 
                    would travel to. As our relationship progressed, she became more and more distant,
                    and eventually hostile. We fought all the time, and she lost patience for me even though
                    I had not done anything of evil intent.
                    In the end, she broke my heart and cheated on me suddenly and unexpectedly. The thing is,
                    I would probably not have been so hurt if it was only physical. But it was emotional, and she fell in 
                    love with someone else. The emotional aspect of that broke my heart. The fact that my girlfriend 
                    felt something in her heart for someone other than me is what did it. There was no coming back
                    and even though I had begged her to reconsider, that we had built such an amazing relationship, she
                    did not listen.</p>

                <h1>He Cared More About Himself</h1>
                <p>We had been dating for about a year, and he started taking me for granted. 
                    Oftentimes I would plan for us to do something, and he would choose to
                    go with his friends instead. He threatened often that he would break up 
                    with me if I did not pay for his meals, his friends, and other things. 
                    Eventually, he made me clean his house, pay for everything else, and
                    even set up a profile for him on a dating website. I did everything he asked 
                    because I was so in love. After a few months of that nightmare, I seeked out
                    a personal therapist and sought advice for our relationship. I asked him to 
                    go with me to therapy sessiosn but he refused and continued his behaviour. In the end,
                    I told him if he did not stop his behaviour and go with me to a therapist that I will break 
                    up with him. He still refused and therefore I left. To this day, some part of me still
                    wished that he agreed to go with me to the therapist and I am saddened that I put so
                    much effort and time into someone who was just stubborn and refused to change.</p>

                <h1>Everything Became A Fight</h1>
                <p>My partner and I started out really well. We both thought we had met
                    our soulmates. We were living in a paradise. We had so much fun with each
                    other and we loved each other very much. It was all heavenly and something
                    that we knew was very hard to find in an entire lifetime. Two years down the 
                    road, we fight about every single little thing. Whether it's about money, 
                    cleaning, the car, the bills, even our different preferences of music and politics.
                    My partner is incredibly stubborn as am I, and it just couldn't work out the way
                    we had imagined before. We lost it and we seperated and deleted each others' numbers,
                    blocked each other on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Snapchat, and completely erased
                    each other from our lives because of how angry we were at each other. Since our breakup,
                    my feelings have subsided, but I realize that there is no way I will never get them back
                    now.</p>
