                    <h1>Poke Wrap?!</h1>
                    <p>Welcome back to school, lovely students from across the GTA! You may have noticed by now that 
                        Poke Wrap on Yonge street had an amazing deal this past week! $8 for a regular poke wrap or bowl 
                        and of course, this includes a stamp on the Poke Wrap loyalty card. Now let's dive into what we thought about
                        this deal and of course, how good is Poke wrap really?
                    </p>
                    <p>Well, Poke Wrap is definitely on the cheaper side of poke. M'Hito just opened up on Yonge &amp; Edward but its prices
                        have soared through the ceiling. So without any real competitors in the area, is Poke Wrap worth it? <br/>
                        The answer is a resounding YES. Being one of the ONLY healthy food joints on Yonge st, this baby allows you endless
                        customization over your wrap or bowl, which can't be said for most of the other poke joints. In a regular sized option,
                        you're allowed 2 meats, 3 veggies & others, and endless toppings. You can also pick your sauce! <br/>
                        In conclusion, I would recommend this food joint to everyone anyday!

                        <h1>Essential Toronto Madness?!</h1>
                        <p>This is going to be a tough one, essentially because Essential Toronto is the bomb and it is really hard to list the cons of this place.
                            Let's start with the atmosphere. Upon entering this private streetwear shop, you'll see a huge wall of coveted shoes. Some worth more than your
                            cellphone. Additionally, there are racks of expensive, coveted, streetwear clothing taking up most of the square space of the store. 
                        </p>
                        <p>It should be said that the coolest thing this place has to offer besides its items is the yeezy keymaster machine. It's got dozens of Yeezy sneakers
                            and occasionally some Jordans. This machine is the main selling and marketing point of Essential. If you have not seen their 
                            <a href="https://www.instagram.com/essential_toronto/?hl=en"target="_blank">Instagram</a> yet, give it a look. They've got hundreds of photos
                            of people winning yeezy's from the keymaster. From what I learned in school, gambling is an ever-growing business, which may be in part why the keymaster
                            at Essential has been so popular. Definitely go in and give the store a browse, you might be surprised what you find/win. 
                        </p>
