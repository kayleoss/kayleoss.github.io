Welcome! 

This is a website that displays some information about myself, Katie Liu.
I have used the Jquery Plugin: Secretnav for my navigation bar.

There are two sections on my website. 

--Homepage--
This is where a couple of animations happen, each containing some important information about myself.
Additionally, media icons will slide down allowing the user to see my social media networks as well as contact me by email.

--Demo Projects --
This page consists of some of the projects I have built. 

I am working on putting more complete and well-rounded projects on my website to showcase more of my skill.
I may also introduce a product page in the near future that will allow users to purchase my handcoded website template files.


Thanks for visiting! 

-Katie
