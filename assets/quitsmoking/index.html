I'm 29 years old and I have been smoking since I was 12. QST worked with me to beat my habit and after a year, I quit for good. I'm happy to recommend QST to anyone because it really is the easiest and fastest way to go cold. There are no supplements involved, nothing. You just go cold. I've never met any organization that does what they do so well. QST, you have my thanks for years to come."</p></div><div class="cell small-12 large-6 medium-6 review"><img src="http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/44/45/20/9589775/3/920x1240.jpg"><h1 class="title" style="margin-top:0;color:black">Amy</h1><p class="text">"Hi, my name is Amy.
