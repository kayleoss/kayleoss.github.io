<h2>#KodeWithKatie</h2>
<p>Since her introduction to languages HTML and CSS in June 2017, Katie has since used her newly learned knowledge to create a variety of different projects. The first project she created was a personal <a href="http://kdlblog.com"target="_blank">travel blog.</a> Albeit not very aesthetically pleasing, she used the travel blog as an opportunity to practice her code. Since then, she has been coding for at least 2 hours a day and hopes to expand her knowledge of Javascript, Jquery, and Ruby to a working level in the near future. </p></div>
